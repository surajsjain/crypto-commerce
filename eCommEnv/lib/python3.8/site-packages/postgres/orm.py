It's somewhat of a fool's errand to introduce a Python ORM in 2013, with
`SQLAlchemy`_ ascendant (`Django's ORM`_ not-withstanding). And yet here we
are. SQLAlchemy is mature and robust and full-featured. This makes it complex,
difficult to learn, and kind of scary. The ORM we introduce here is simpler: it
targets PostgreSQL only, it depends on raw SQL (it has no object model for
schema definition nor one for query construction), and it never updates your
database for you. You are in full, direct control of your application's
database usage.

.. _SQLAlchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/
.. _Django's ORM: http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter05.html

The fundamental technique we employ, introduced by `Michael Robbelard at PyOhio
2013`_, is to write SQL queries that "typecast" results to table types, and then
use a :class:`~psycopg2.extras.CompositeCaster` subclass to map
these to Python objects.  This means we get to define our schema in SQL, and we
get to write our queries in SQL, and we get to explicitly indicate in our SQL
queries how Python should map the results to objects, and then we can write
Python objects that contain only business logic and not schema definitions.

Introducing Table Types
-----------------------

Every table in PostgreSQL has a type associated with it, which is the column
definition for that table. These are composite types just like any other
composite type in PostgreSQL, meaning we can use them to cast query results.
When we do, we get a single field that contains our query result, nested one
level::

    test=# CREATE TABLE foo (bar text, baz int);
    CREATE TABLE
    test=# INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('blam', 42);
    INSERT 0 1
    test=# INSERT INTO foo VALUES ('whit', 537);
    INSERT 0 1
    test=# SELECT * FROM foo;
    +------+-----+
    | bar  | baz |
    +------+-----+
    | blam |  42 |
    | whit | 537 |
    +------+-----+
    (2 rows)

    test=# SELECT foo FROM foo;
    +------------+
    |    foo     |
    +------------+
    | (blam,42)  |
    | (whit,537) |
    +------------+
    (2 rows)

    test=#

The same thing works for views::

    test=# CREATE VIEW bar AS SELECT bar FROM foo;
    CREATE VIEW
    test=# SELECT * FROM bar;
    +------+
    | bar  |
    +------+
    | blam |
    | whit |
    +------+
    (2 rows)

    test=# SELECT bar FROM bar;
    +--------+
    |  bar   |
    +--------+
    | (blam) |
    | (whit) |
    +--------+
    (2 rows)

    test=#

:mod:`psycopg2` provides a :func:`~psycopg2.extras.register_composite`
function that lets us map PostgreSQL composite types to Python objects. This
includes table and view types, and that is the basis for
:mod:`postgres.orm`. We map based on types, not tables.

ORM Tutorial
------------

First, write a Python class that subclasses :class:`~postgres.orm.Model`::

    >>> from postgres.orm import Model
    >>> class Foo(Model):
    ...     typname = "foo"
    ...

Your model must have a :attr:`typname` attribute, which is the name of the
PostgreSQL type for which this class is an object mapping. (``typname``,
spelled without an "e," is the name of the relevant column in the ``pg_type``
table in your database.)

Second, register your model with your :class:`~postgres.Postgres` instance:

    >>> db.register_model(Foo)

That will plug your model into the :mod:`psycopg2` composite casting
machinery, and you'll now get instances of your model back from
:meth:`~postgres.Postgres.one` and :meth:`~postgres.Postgres.all` when
you cast to the relevant type in your query. If your query returns more than
one column, you'll need to dereference the column containing the model just as
with any other query:

    >>> rec = db.one(\"""
    ...     SELECT foo, bar.*
    ...       FROM foo
    ...       JOIN bar ON foo.bar = bar.bar
    ...   ORDER BY foo.bar
    ...      LIMIT 1
    ... \""")
    >>> rec.foo.bar
    'blam'
    >>> rec.bar
    'blam'

And as usual, if your query only returns one column, then
:meth:`~postgres.Postgres.one` and :meth:`~postgres.Postgres.all`
will do the dereferencing for you:

    >>> foo = db.one("SELECT foo FROM foo WHERE bar='blam'")
    >>> foo.bar
    'blam'
    >>> [foo.bar for foo in db.all("SELECT foo FROM foo")]
    ['blam', 'whit']

To update your database, add a method to your model:

    >>> db.unregister_model(Foo)
    >>> class Foo(Model):
    ...
    ...     typname = "foo"
    ...
    ...     def update_baz(self, baz):
    ...         self.db.run("UPDATE foo SET baz=%s WHERE bar=%s", (baz, self.bar))
    ...         self.set_attributes(baz=baz)
    ...
    >>> db.register_model(Foo)

Then use that method to update the database:

    >>> db.one("SELECT baz FROM foo WHERE bar='blam'")
    42
    >>> foo = db.one("SELECT foo FROM foo WHERE bar='blam'")
    >>> foo.update_baz(90210)
    >>> foo.baz
    90210
    >>> db.one("SELECT baz FROM foo WHERE bar='blam'")
    90210

We never update your database for you. We also never sync your objects for you:
note the use of the :meth:`~postgres.orm.Model.set_attributes` method to
sync our instance after modifying the database.
